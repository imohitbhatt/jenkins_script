# jenkins_script
A jenkinsfile which takes two mandatory user inputs and prompts the user with a question asking if they want to enter any other value.
If yes, then it becomes a loop giving user a chance to enter another value and asking that same question again and again.
If the user chooses 'no', then only it is going to terminate with a result reflecting the addition of all the previously entered values.
